## **Version1.0 â€“ User Story Table**

We add a "**Requirement Type**" Column to summarise what function/features are required by the user, to achieve the goal of their story. And Story 08 & 16 is emphasised as 'needed' by our client during the client meeting, so we keep the "**Heat Map**" requirements as In-Scope of our project. Similarly, the story 07 & 15 is mentioned by [Eduardo Araujo Oliveira](https://confluence.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8443/display/~oliveirae) during the supervisor meeting, so we also keep these two "**Social**" requirements as In-Scope of our project. However, we may make exclusion when scope change occurs.

## In Scope

The Garmin API project will focus on how Users' data from its workout sessions is being synchronised between devices and dashboards through the Garmin API.
