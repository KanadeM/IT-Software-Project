# Sprint 4 Assessment Checklist
This checklist helps you double check your work for Sprint 4.

## Meetings
Make sure your meetings (team meetings, supervision meetings and meetings with industry partners) are documented in Confluence (and only). 

- [x] Meetings are recorded in Confluence and only. They were NOT exported to Github as they're part of internal process.


## Release notes
Make sure that:

- [x] Students created a clear and complete document explaining the client how to access developed resources, how they are organised on Github, and also provided details on how to run their project (digital prototypes).


## Release TAG
Make sure that:

- [x] Students generated a release TAG on Github (containing all project resources, including exported documents/diagrams from Confluence).


## ZIP File
Make sure that:

- [x] Students created an organised release to the client on Github, including: documents, tests, data samples, prototypes, and images. 
- [x] Release was downloaded from Github, packed in a ZIP file, sent to the client (together with release notes) and added to Confluence (under Handover page).


## Final Presentation Slides
Make sure that:

- [x] Added to Confluence and Github. Industry partner will receive it as part of final release package.


## High Fidelity Digital Prototype and Data Sample
Make sure that:

- [x] Industry partner was granted access to the final version of digital prototype and can run it independently after the end of the teaching semester. 
- [x] A document was also generated with SAMPLE DATA industry partner will need to simulate tasks and scenarios in the final digital prototype.


## Self-reflection 

Self-reflection is one document for the whole team (with one subsection for each student and a final one for the whole team explaining how they addressed received feedback in the project).

Make sure that the self-reflection contains:

- [x] 250 words maximum per student
- [x] Self-reflection about students' journey in the subject and brief discussion on what & how they addressed received feedback after usability tests with clients.
